# Affiliate System Enhancements Log

This document tracks all changes made to the affiliate system, focusing on improvements and bug fixes.

## Data Drive Functionality

### 1. Fixed 500 Internal Server Error
- **Issue**: System returned 500 Internal Server Error when initiating a data drive
- **Root Cause**: Missing "is_active" column in the products table
- **Solution**: Created SQL script to add the missing column

### 2. Database Connection Fixes
- **Issue**: Database connection failing in certain environments
- **Solution**: Updated `server/config/db.js` to use absolute path to .env file
- **Added**: Verification script (`scripts/verify_drive_tables.js`) to check required tables

### 3. API Base URL Standardization
- **Issue**: Inconsistent API URL usage causing fetch failures
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `drive.js` to consistently use API_BASE_URL for all fetch requests
  - Added API_BASE_URL definition to drive.html

### 4. Database Schema Corrections
- **Issue**: Incorrect SQL syntax in table definitions
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed SQL syntax in `init.sql` and `add_drive_orders_table.sql` to use PostgreSQL syntax
  - Updated products table with required image_url and commission_rate columns
  - Added missing drive_orders table to init.sql

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Added**: Debug console to drive.html (accessible with Ctrl+Shift+D)
- **Added**: Detailed logging in driveController.js
- **Added**: Dedicated drive logger at server/utils/driveLogger.js
- **Added**: Debug console styling in public/css/debug.css

### 6. User Experience Improvements
- **Added**: Progress bar to task.html to show data drive completion status
- **Fixed**: Daily profit display in account.html by updating userController.js to include 'data_drive' commission type
- **Added**: Commission earned display in the task.html page to show real-time earnings
- **Added**: Visual highlight effect when commission is earned for better feedback

## Current State
The data drive functionality now works correctly. Users can:
1. Start a data drive
2. See their progress with a visual progress bar
3. Track their commission earnings directly in the task interface
4. See daily profits from data drive activities in their account page

## Potential Future Enhancements
1. Add ability to pause/resume data drives
2. Implement detailed analytics for drive performance
3. Add email notifications for drive completion
4. Improve mobile responsiveness of the drive interface

## Recent Updates - May 11, 2025

### 7. Commission Data Persistence
- **Issue**: Commission earned during a data drive was not persisting across page refreshes
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented localStorage-based storage for commission data
  - Added session data tracking with `saveCurrentSessionData()` and `getCurrentSessionData()`
  - Enhanced `updateDriveCommission()` to load/save commission between refreshes
  - Updated `checkDriveStatus()` to retrieve stored commission when checking drive status
  - Added drive history tracking when drives are completed
  - Fixed syntax errors in the driveController.js file
  - Added drive_session_id to commission_logs for better tracking

### 8. UI Polish and User Experience Improvements
- **Enhanced**: Commission display now persists between page refreshes
- **Added**: "Start New Drive" button now properly resets commission counters
- **Added**: Historical tracking of completed drives (can be used for future analytics)
- **Updated**: Progress bar implementation with smoother transitions
- **Fixed**: Corrected multiple JavaScript errors improving overall stability

### 9. Code Organization and Best Practices
- Improved code architecture with dedicated functions for session data management
- Added appropriate documentation for new functions
- Implemented clean-up routines to prevent data leakage between drives
- Separated session data management into its own file (session-data.js) for better organization
- Ensured database tracking of commissions by drive session for accurate reporting

### 10. Working Days Tracking on Dashboard
- **Added**: New database tables (user_drive_progress, user_working_days) to track daily drive completions
- **Implemented**: Dashboard progress bar that shows weekly working days progress (0-7 days)
- **Added**: Automatic tracking of completed working days (2 drives = 1 working day)
- **Added**: Visual indicators when daily quota is completed
- **Updated**: dashboard.js to fetch and display real-time drive progress statistics

### 11. Admin Panel Drive Management Improvements
- **Issue**: Missing proper drive history view and 404 errors on admin panel
- **Solution**:
  - Added new `/admin/drives/:userId/logs` API endpoint to fetch drive history
  - Enhanced drive data display with real-time updates
  - Added drive history modal showing all past drives and commission per drive
  - Fixed jQuery dialog functionality by adding proper jQuery UI dependencies
