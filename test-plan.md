# Testing Plan for Data Drive Functionality Fixes

## Background
Users have been encountering 500 Internal Server Errors when trying to save orders in the data drive functionality. The issue appears to be related to parameter handling, particularly when users start a data drive and click to process/purchase products.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Happy Path Flow
- **Test Objective**: Verify the basic data drive flow works with valid parameters
- **Steps**:
  1. Log in with a valid user account
  2. Navigate to the data drive page
  3. Click "Start" button 
  4. Wait for the carousel animation to complete
  5. When a product appears, click "Purchase"
  6. Observe if the order is saved successfully
- **Expected Result**: Order is saved without any errors, and the next product is displayed or drive completion is shown

### 2. Session ID Recovery
- **Test Objective**: Verify that the system can recover from missing or invalid session IDs
- **Steps**:
  1. Start a data drive session
  2. Open browser developer tools and manually clear the `current_drive_session_id` from localStorage
  3. Refresh the page
  4. Observe if the system recovers and displays the active drive
- **Expected Result**: System should detect missing session ID and recover by checking with the server, then continue the drive

### 3. Parameter Handling with Edge Cases
- **Test Objective**: Verify robust parameter handling and validation
- **Steps**:
  1. Start a data drive session
  2. Use browser developer tools to modify the `currentProductData` object to have an invalid or missing `order_id`
  3. Click "Purchase" button
  4. Observe how the system handles the error
- **Expected Result**: System should detect invalid parameters, show appropriate error message, and provide recovery options

### 4. Retry Mechanism for 500 Errors
- **Test Objective**: Verify the retry mechanism works when encountering a 500 error
- **Steps**:
  1. Start a data drive session
  2. If possible, simulate a 500 error by temporarily modifying the API endpoint or server response
  3. Click "Purchase" button
  4. When error occurs, click "Retry with Fixed Data" button
- **Expected Result**: System should display the retry option, and when clicked, it should attempt the purchase with sanitized data

### 5. Order ID Fallback Mechanism
- **Test Objective**: Verify the system can handle various order ID formats from the API response
- **Steps**:
  1. Start a data drive session
  2. Observe server response for different field names (id, order_id, drive_order_id, etc.)
  3. Verify purchase works with each format
- **Expected Result**: System should correctly extract order ID from various possible fields in the response

### 6. Cross-Browser Compatibility
- **Test Objective**: Verify fixes work across different browsers
- **Steps**:
  1. Test the data drive functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
  2. Complete a full drive cycle in each browser
- **Expected Result**: Functionality should work consistently across all browsers

### 7. Error Messaging
- **Test Objective**: Verify error messages are clear and helpful
- **Steps**:
  1. Trigger various error conditions (network error, server error, validation error)
  2. Observe the error messages displayed to the user
- **Expected Result**: Error messages should be clear, user-friendly, and provide guidance on what to do next

## Server-Side Recommendations

### Logging
- Add detailed logging on the server-side to capture:
  - All parameters received in the saveorder endpoint
  - Validation failures with specific fields that failed
  - Database errors with query details

### Parameter Consistency
- Ensure server-side validation matches client-side validation
- Standardize parameter names between client and server (e.g., consistently use `drive_order_id` instead of mixing with `order_id`)

### Error Responses
- Return structured error responses with:
  - Specific error codes
  - Detailed error messages
  - Fields that failed validation
  - Suggested recovery actions

## Monitoring
- Implement monitoring to track:
  - 500 error rates on the saveorder endpoint
  - Parameter validation failures
  - Session ID mismatches
  - Drive completion rates

By following this testing plan, we can verify that the fixes resolve the 500 Internal Server Error and ensure a more robust data drive experience for users.
