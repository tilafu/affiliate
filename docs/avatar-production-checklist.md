# Avatar Upload Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up AWS S3 bucket with proper permissions
- [ ] Configure CDN (CloudFront) for avatar delivery
- [ ] Set up monitoring for storage usage
- [ ] Configure backup strategy for avatar files

### Security
- [ ] Implement proper CORS settings for S3
- [ ] Set up WAF rules for upload endpoints
- [ ] Configure rate limiting at load balancer level
- [ ] Enable virus scanning for uploaded files
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates for avatar domains

### Database
- [ ] Run avatar_production_optimizations.sql
- [ ] Set up database connection pooling
- [ ] Configure read replicas if needed
- [ ] Set up database backups

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch/monitoring for S3 operations
- [ ] Configure alerts for failed uploads
- [ ] Set up logging aggregation
- [ ] Implement error tracking (Sentry/Rollbar)

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxx
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxx
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-avatars-bucket
MAX_AVATAR_SIZE=5242880
```

### Optional Performance Variables
```bash
ENABLE_IMAGE_COMPRESSION=true
AVATAR_QUALITY=85
CDN_BASE_URL=https://cdn.yourdomain.com
ENABLE_CDN=true
```

## Post-Deployment

### Testing
- [ ] Test avatar upload in production environment
- [ ] Verify S3 integration works correctly
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Verify old avatar cleanup works
- [ ] Test error handling and logging

### Performance
- [ ] Monitor upload response times
- [ ] Check S3 costs and optimize
- [ ] Verify CDN cache hit rates
- [ ] Monitor database query performance

### Security
- [ ] Audit file permissions
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Test rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Validate file type restrictions

## Scaling Considerations

### High Traffic
- Use multiple S3 regions for global distribution
- Implement background job processing for image optimization
- Consider using AWS Lambda for serverless image processing
- Set up auto-scaling for API servers

### Cost Optimization
- Implement S3 lifecycle policies for old avatars
- Use S3 Intelligent Tiering
- Optimize image compression settings
- Monitor and alert on storage costs

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur
1. Disable avatar upload endpoint
2. Rollback to previous deployment
3. Revert database migrations if needed
4. Clean up any orphaned S3 files
5. Notify users of temporary unavailability
