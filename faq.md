 What is Product Engagement?

 Product Engagement on CDOT is a marketing support service where you assist online sellers in boosting visibility for their products on platforms like Amazon and Etsy. These sellers rely on real user interactions such as views, carts, and purchases to increase search momentum and reach more customers. That’s where you play a role. When you engage, you're matched with a product and complete a standard checkout just like any regular customer. This helps generate natural activity, which improves the product’s search ranking. After your engagement is confirmed (usually within 1 to 5 minutes), the full amount is immediately credited back to your CDOT balance, along with your engagement reward, based on your tier.
