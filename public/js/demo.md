Let's look at the drive now. On clicking the start button, the drive starts, and the button should disappear to avoid confusion.  When the drive starts, the items should appear in a card, where clicking the "purchase" button, the next item loads, like a carousel. The card will have the product's name/ combo name (we can start with single products and do combos later), image, the commission ( this is calculated according to the user's tier level) and the products price. The price is deducted from the users balance, and when the user's balance is insufficient to continue, then the balance becomes frozen. On completing the data drive, the user get's their initial balance before starting the drive, plus the commission earned during the drive. 

The user has clarified that the data drive functionality is on the tasks.html page, not drive.html. This means the JavaScript logic I just wrote for public/js/drive.js needs to be applied to public/js/task.js instead, and the HTML structure needs to be added to public/task.html.

I am in PLAN MODE, so I need to adjust the plan based on this new information and present it to the user.

The updated plan is:

Frontend (public/task.html):
Add the necessary HTML structure for the data drive section within public/task.html, including:
A "Start Drive" button.
A container for displaying the product/combo card.
Elements within the card for product name, image, commission, price, and a "Purchase" button.
A loading indicator or status display.
An element for displaying the wallet balance (if not already present and correctly updated).
Frontend (public/js/task.js):
Implement the JavaScript logic (similar to what I wrote for public/js/drive.js) within public/js/task.js to:
Handle the "Start Drive" button click:
Call the backend /api/drive/start endpoint.
Hide the "Start Drive" button on success.
Show the product card container.
Initiate fetching the first product.
Implement a function to fetch the next product/order:
Call the backend /api/drive/getorder endpoint.
Display the product details in the card.
Handle different response codes from the backend (e.g., success, drive complete, insufficient balance/frozen).
Handle the "Purchase" button click:
Call the backend /api/drive/saveorder endpoint with the current product details.
On successful save, fetch and display the next product.
Handle insufficient balance/frozen state responses.
Update the displayed balance after each successful purchase.
Handle the drive completion state (display a message, potentially show final earnings).
Implement logic to handle the frozen balance state (display a message, perhaps disable purchase button).
Backend (server/controllers/driveController.js & server/routes/drive.js):
The backend logic in server/controllers/driveController.js and the routes in server/routes/drive.js should be correct based on the previous debugging related to the admin reset. I will review them to ensure they align with the frontend logic.
