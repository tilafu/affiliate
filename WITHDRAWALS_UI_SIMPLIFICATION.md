# Withdrawals Page Simplification - Type and Note Columns Removed

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Changes (`public/withdraws.html`)
- **Removed Type Column**: Deleted "Type" column header from withdrawal history table
- **Removed Note Column**: Deleted "Note" column header from withdrawal history table  
- **Updated colspan**: Changed loading and error messages from `colspan="6"` to `colspan="4"`
- **Cleaned up CSS**: Removed unused type-specific badge styling (`.type-admin_adjustment`, `.type-withdrawal`)

### 2. JavaScript Changes (`public/js/withdraw.js`)
- **Simplified Table Generation**: Removed type display and admin note columns from table rows
- **Streamlined Logic**: Removed complex type determination logic (typeDisplay, statusClass calculations)
- **Kept Essential Styling**: Maintained amount prefix logic (+/- for admin credits/deductions)
- **Updated Error Handling**: Changed colspan from 6 to 4 in empty state and error messages

## Before vs After

### Before (6 columns):
| Date | Time | Amount | Type | Status | Note |
|------|------|--------|------|--------|------|
| 12/15/2024 | 2:30 PM | -$100.00 | Withdrawal | Pending | - |
| 12/14/2024 | 1:15 PM | +$50.00 | Admin Credit | Completed | Bonus payment |

### After (4 columns):
| Date | Time | Amount | Status |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| 12/15/2024 | 2:30 PM | -$100.00 | Pending |
| 12/14/2024 | 1:15 PM | +$50.00 | Completed |

## What's Preserved
- **Amount Sign Logic**: Still shows `+` for admin credits and `-` for withdrawals/deductions
- **Status Display**: All withdrawal statuses (Pending, Completed, etc.) are still shown
- **Total Calculations**: Total withdrawals calculation remains unchanged
- **Backend Tracking**: Admin adjustments are still tracked in the backend (just not displayed in detail)

## Benefits
- **Cleaner Interface**: Less cluttered withdrawal history table
- **Simplified View**: Users see essential information without technical details
- **Faster Loading**: Less DOM manipulation for large transaction histories
- **Better Mobile Experience**: Fewer columns means better responsive design

## Technical Details
- **Backend APIs**: No changes needed - all tracking still works
- **Data Processing**: Admin adjustments are still processed but displayed more simply
- **CSS Cleanup**: Removed unused type badge styles to reduce file size
