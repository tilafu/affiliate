# Admin Fund Adjustments Tracking Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that when admins add or reduce funds through the user management interface, these adjustments are properly tracked and displayed in the client's frontend.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Admin Controller (`server/controllers/adminController.js`)
- The `manualTransaction` function already logs admin adjustments to the `commission_logs` table
- Admin deposits are logged with `commission_type = 'admin_deposit'`
- Admin withdrawals are logged with `commission_type = 'admin_withdrawal'`

### 2. User Controller (`server/controllers/userController.js`)

#### Updated Functions:

**`getUserDeposits`** - Now includes admin deposits
- Combines regular deposits from `deposits` table
- Includes admin deposits from `commission_logs` with `commission_type = 'admin_deposit'`
- Returns unified data with `type` field to distinguish between regular deposits and admin adjustments

**`getUserTotalDeposits`** - Now includes admin deposits in total
- Sums completed deposits from `deposits` table
- Adds admin deposits from `commission_logs` table
- Returns total including all deposit sources

**`getWithdrawHistory`** - Now includes admin withdrawals
- Combines regular withdrawals from `withdrawals` table
- Includes admin withdrawals from `commission_logs` with `commission_type = 'admin_withdrawal'`
- Returns unified data with `type` field to distinguish between regular withdrawals and admin adjustments

**`getUserWithdrawals`** - Now includes admin withdrawals in total
- Sums approved withdrawals from `withdrawals` table
- Adds admin withdrawals from `commission_logs` table
- Returns total including all withdrawal sources

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Deposit Page (`public/js/deposit.js`)
- Updated to handle new data structure (using `response.data` instead of `response.history`)
- Displays admin adjustments with proper styling:
  - Admin Credits: Green badge with positive amount
  - Admin Deductions: Orange badge with negative amount
- Shows admin notes in a separate column
- Updated form submission to use modern notifications instead of jQuery dialogs

### 2. Withdrawal Page (`public/js/withdraw.js`)
- Updated to handle new data structure (using `response.data` instead of `response.history`)
- Displays admin adjustments with proper styling:
  - Admin Credits: Green badge with positive amount prefix
  - Admin Deductions: Orange badge with negative amount prefix
- Shows admin notes in a separate column
- Fixed template literal syntax error

### 3. HTML Templates
- **`public/deposits.html`**: Added Type and Note columns to deposit history table
- **`public/withdraws.html`**: Added Type and Note columns to withdrawal history table
- Added CSS styling for admin adjustment badges and type indicators

## Data Structure

### Admin Adjustments in commission_logs table:
```sql
INSERT INTO commission_logs (
    user_id, 
    source_user_id, 
    account_type, 
    commission_amount, 
    commission_type, 
    description
) VALUES (
    [target_user_id], 
    [admin_user_id], 
    'main', 
    [amount], 
    'admin_deposit' OR 'admin_withdrawal', 
    [admin_description]
);
```

### Frontend Display:
- **Type**: 'admin_adjustment' for admin actions, 'deposit'/'withdrawal' for user actions
- **Admin Note**: Description field from commission_logs for admin adjustments
- **Amount**: Positive for credits, negative for deductions
- **Status**: Always 'completed' for admin adjustments

## CSS Styling
Added consistent styling across both deposit and withdrawal pages:
- `.status-success`: Green styling for admin credits
- `.status-warning`: Orange styling for admin deductions
- `.type-admin_adjustment`: Blue styling for admin adjustment type badges
- `.text-muted`: Gray styling for admin notes

## API Endpoints Updated:
- `GET /api/user/deposits` - Now returns admin deposits
- `GET /api/user/deposits/total` - Now includes admin deposits in total
- `GET /api/user/withdraw-history` - Now returns admin withdrawals
- `GET /api/user/withdrawals` - Now includes admin withdrawals in total

## Benefits:
1. **Transparency**: Users can see all fund movements including admin adjustments
2. **Accountability**: Admin actions are logged with admin notes
3. **Accurate Totals**: Total deposits and withdrawals include all sources
4. **Clear Distinction**: Visual differentiation between user actions and admin adjustments
5. **Consistency**: Unified display across both deposit and withdrawal pages

## Usage:
When an admin performs a manual transaction through the admin panel:
1. The transaction is immediately reflected in the user's balance
2. The adjustment is logged in the commission_logs table
3. The adjustment appears in the user's deposit/withdrawal history
4. The adjustment is included in the user's total deposit/withdrawal amounts
5. The admin's reason/note is displayed to provide context
