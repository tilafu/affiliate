# Data Drive Error Fixes

## Identified issues and solutions implemented to fix the 500 Internal Server Error when initiating a data drive:

### 1. Database Connection Issues:
- Fixed the database connection in `server/config/db.js` by using an absolute path to the `.env` file.
- Created a verification script (`scripts/verify_drive_tables.js`) to check if all required tables exist.

### 2. API Base URL:
- Updated the client-side code in `drive.js` to properly use the `API_BASE_URL` for all fetch requests.
- Added the `API_BASE_URL` definition to the `drive.html` file.

### 3. Database Schema:
- Fixed the table definitions in `sql/init.sql` and `sql/add_drive_orders_table.sql` to use PostgreSQL syntax.
- Updated the `products` table to include `image_url` and `commission_rate` columns required by the drive functionality.
- Added the missing `drive_orders` table to the `init.sql` file.

### 4. Error Handling and Debugging:
- Added enhanced error handling in the client-side `drive.js` file.
- Added a debug console to `drive.html` that can be accessed with Ctrl+Shift+D.
- Added more detailed logging in the server-side `driveController.js` file.
- Created a dedicated drive logger at `server/utils/driveLogger.js`.

### 5. CSS Styling:
- Added debug console styling in `public/css/debug.css`.

### 6. Progress Bar and User Experience:
- Added a progress bar to `task.html` to show completion status of the data drive
- Fixed daily profit display in `account.html` by updating `userController.js` to include 'data_drive' commission type
- Added commission earned display to the data drive interface with visual feedback when commission is earned
- Created `system_enhancement_log.md` to track all system changes
- Implemented commission persistence between page refreshes using localStorage
- Improved code organization by creating a separate `session-data.js` file
- Fixed syntax errors in driveController.js for stable operation
- Enhanced commission tracking with drive_session_id in database records

## Potential Issues That Might Still Need Addressing:
1. **Database Connection**: Make sure the `.env` file contains the correct database credentials.
2. **Missing Tables**: Run the database verification script to check if all required tables exist.
3. **Products**: Ensure there are active products in the database.
4. **API Routing**: Verify that Express is correctly routing `/api/drive/start` to the drive controller.

## Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Check the server logs for any error messages related to the drive functionality.
2. Use the debug console (Ctrl+Shift+D) in the drive page to see detailed error information.
3. Verify the status code returned by the server when trying to start a drive.
4. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors.
5. Make sure the user has sufficient balance (minimum 50.00 USDT) to start a data drive.

## Next Steps:
If the issue persists, you may need to check:
1. The server's PostgreSQL logs for any SQL errors.
2. The network tab in the browser's developer tools to see the exact request and response.
3. Try running the SQL scripts manually to ensure all tables are properly created.
