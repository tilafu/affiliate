Combo Design
Let’s redesign the data drive. I want a fxn that looks at the user’s balance, then looks for products filtered below the user’s balance. E.g. for $100 balance, products range from $80 to $99, the function will look for the number of products per their tier level. For the task set/ combo products/ merge products, a single task set can have up to 3 products, and the admin should be able to pick a task set on the drive progress modal. This means the drive progress modal should show the first task set item, but when the admin clicks on the create combo btn (which will be placed next to each task set on the modal) it should have a row, where the admin can add another task item / product (up to 2 more products) which will appear in the front end as a combo product, (many products in one task set, so the task number remains the same for combos). Please be careful about task sets and task set items, because I don’t want the admin add to replace the item, it should come after the item, and still go through all the other pending items in the drive, not reducing the total number of task sets and task set items remaining in the drive. Any questions before you map out the plan.
Considerations
1.	Balance-based filtering formula: You mentioned "$100 balance → products $80-$99". Is this always 80%-99% of the balance, or are there different ranges for different balance tiers?

Balance is filtered to 75% to 99% of the persons current balance.

1.	Tier-level product quantities: You mentioned "the function will look for the number of products per their tier level." What are the specific rules? For example:
o	Bronze tier: X products per task set
o	Silver tier: Y products per task set
o	Gold tier: Z products per task set
Tiers will have an adjustable values form in the admin panel
1.	Combo insertion logic: When an admin creates a combo by adding 1-2 products to an existing task set, where exactly should these combo products be inserted in the drive sequence?
o	Right after the original task set item?
o	At the end of the drive?
o	Somewhere else?
A task set can contain up to 3 products (task set items), if you need sql tables and columns to see them let me know. The combo products ( 2nd and / or 3rd ) is inserted after the original task item, which was set by config generator function.

1.	Database impact: Should we modify the existing user_active_drive_items table structure, or create new tables for combo management?
Look at existing ones and the columsn if relevant. Otherwise make new.


1.	Frontend combo display: How should combos appear differently from single products in the user's drive interface?
Combo products will have a blue hue around them.


1.	Pricing logic: For combo products, should the total price be sum of individual products, or have special combo pricing?
Combo products have a 4.5 commission rate.

Clean admin drives of unused functions with the new system. (after verifying it works)
