The chat functionality is supposed to work like whatsapp, i.e. there is a group and a dm functionality. The goal is to have the users interact with the "fake users" in the group, where the admins and fake users will be posting. The user can dm anyone in the same group and have a conversatoin outside the group. The chat feature, therefore, has the admin side (admin-chat.html), where they will be communicating with the users as DMs and the front side (chat/index.html) where the users will be seeing their messages, and responding in the groups and talking to the fake users. Additionally, all new users will have a group created after they join, and the group will have fake users (approximately 20). this might mean we use the same fake users for all the groups, but since the admin will be using these users for all groups, they'll need to seperate the different users and group message responsing. Additionally, on the frontend the client (differentiate this from fake users, who are controlled by the admin, the clients have registered and are stored in the db with role===user) will only see the groups they are in on the frontend, i.e. common groups, and their group, (this group made for the client i think would be easier if we have a similar name across all clients and we store it with the client info).
