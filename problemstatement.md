I'm designing an affiliate program system. Here are the technical requirements. A user (downliner) can only join the platform when they invited by someone (upliner). Each user has a unique referral code. The upliner gets 20% of the commission their downliner gets, at no expense to the downliner (company foots it). Upon registration, the downliner gets an account loaded with $15. The downliner will also get a training account, loaded with $500. From this account, the downliner will get 25% of the commission generated loaded back to their main account. (commission is capped at $200, so they get $50). The training account is closed when they reach the cap and the user gets a total balance of $65 on their main account (initial amount + commission on training account) . On the main account, the user gets to data drive. A data drive is the main income generating activity for the user. Using their account balance, a user interacts with an item, and they get a commission per product. Each product has it's own commission rate. Similarly, each product requires the user to have a certain amount in their account to interact with it, since each product has a monetary value attached to it. This figure is deducted from their account balance, reducing accordingly, meaning there are times the user might be required to top up to continue their drive. There are 2 drives, the first drive requires a user to have at least $50 in their account and the second drive requires the user to have at least $100 in their account. There are tiers, bronze, silver, gold, platinum, which determine how many objects per drive a user gets. (40 for bronze and silver, 45 for gold, 50 for platinum). The second drive will have items with a higher cost and commission but it works the same. After completing a drive, the admin should be notified so they can reset drive. A user can only have 2 drives per day. A drive item can either be one item or multiple items, a combo. A combo can have up to 3 items, with it's total monetary value equalling the sum of the individual items in the combo. This means the commission is also a sum of the items. There are 3 balances the user sees, the current balance, the commission and the frozen balance. The current balance is what the user has in their account, i.e. deposit plus commission. Commission is self explanatory. When a user encounters an object requiring more money than they have in their account, e.g. they have $60 and they meet a combo requiring $70, their current balance and the combo amount are summed to form the frozen balance. The user will be required to top up the frozen balance to their account to continue the drive. The admin will have access to the user's account, and they can adjust the commission and price for each product item.

Here are more details

Referral codes are auto generated with uniqeness checks. Upliners commission are only on the data drive earnings The cap is only on the training account. It is strictly capped, and commission is paid after the training and the cap. Users are moved up the tiers by the admins. Frozen is the total needed, not the deficit, but rather the current + combo cost The user does not lose progress, but they require a reset even to do their second drive. They can't drive again until their account is reset. Their commission and balance remain untouched by the reset. Users have top up according to the products they receive, or at their own will. The top up is done outside the platform and the admin manually adjusts their balance on the platform. Tiers apply globally, affecting both drives. Edits to commissions only affect present and future data drives. Commission is applied real time, immediately after each interaction. The training account is automatically closed when the cap is reached. One of each drive, drive one will not be equal to drive two.

Look at the .md files in the root folder. We are following the roadmap, next phase is the login and registration functionality. Make it as simple and dependancy free as possible.
