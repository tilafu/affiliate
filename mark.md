# Chat Feature Implementation Plan

## Original Requirements
i want the admin to be able to create groups, add, and delete members. Each new user joining the platform will have a group created for them, but they will be members. the admins will be the only people with the ability to add/remove members, and messages. Additionally, each group will have about 20 members (fake). These users can be in each group, but the admin will be able to text to the group as any member, i think this would easier be done on the admin panel, we'll have to create a new tab for the cdot pea communication (i'm very open on how we'll tackle this, maybe 2 different panels for the admin and for the client) keep in mind there are moments admins will be in the same group communicating simulteneously. The 20 "users" will just be a proxy for the admin to communicate with clients. So the admin can take the avatar of any one of the 20 "users" that are not the client. In the groups, the client can click on any user and switch to the dm from the group for personal conversations. The users should also be able to upload and download images oon the site.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Schema (Existing Tables)
- `chat_messages` - Stores messages with group_id, admin_id, sent_by_admin flags
- `chat_groups` - Groups with description, group_type, created_by
- `chat_fake_users` - Fake users with display_name, avatar_url, created_by
- `chat_admin_logs` - Logs admin actions
- `chat_scheduled_messages` - For scheduling messages

### 2. Backend Development
- **API Routes**
  - Create chat groups
  - Manage group members (add/remove)
  - Send/receive messages
  - Upload/download images
  - Delete messages
  - Manage fake users

- **Socket.IO Events**
  - Real-time message delivery
  - Typing indicators
  - Online status updates
  - Notification for new messages

- **Admin Features**
  - API for admin to message as any fake user
  - Group management functions
  - Message moderation capabilities
  - Rate limiting implementation

- **File Storage**
  - Store uploaded images on the filesystem
  - Store file references in the database
  - Implement secure access control

### 3. Frontend Development
- **Client Chat Interface**
  - Enhance existing chat UI
  - Implement group and direct message views
  - Add image upload/download capability
  - Implement real-time updates via Socket.IO

- **Admin Panel**
  - Create new tab for chat management
  - Interface for creating/managing groups
  - UI for selecting which fake user to message as
  - Dashboard for monitoring conversations
  - Templates for quick responses

### 4. Security & Performance
- **Security Measures**
  - Implement rate limiting for message sending
  - Validate file uploads (type, size)
  - Ensure proper access control

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Implement pagination for message history
  - Optimize image loading and caching
  - Efficient Socket.IO connection management

### 5. Testing & Deployment
- Test admin and client interfaces
- Test real-time communication
- Test file uploads/downloads
- Deploy to VPS with proper configuration

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Core functionality (groups, basic messaging)
2. **Phase 2**: Admin features (messaging as fake users)
3. **Phase 3**: File uploads and media sharing
4. **Phase 4**: Templates and advanced features
5. **Phase 5**: Performance optimization and security hardening
